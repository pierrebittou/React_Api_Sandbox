# React.js and Node.js sandbox

This is a sandbox for me to learn React.js and node.js

In this repository, I will aim to create a service working like a dashboard that you can configure with widgets of your choice.

Theses widget will mpstly be displaying data from various API.


## Deployment

To deploy this project you can either use docker with :

```bash
  docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

You can also manually go into the 'client' or the 'server' folder and run :

```bash
  npm install && npm start
```
